  "dc_description_s": "Populated places (polygons) for the Retalhuleu region, Guatemala. This layer was vectorized from original hard copy 1:50,000 topographic maps produced from the early 1970s to the mid 1980s. Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America during the months of October-November of 1998. From 1998 to 2001 the US Geological Survey was involved along with other federal agencies in the reconstruction effort. The source CD consists of a compilation of GIS data layers and computer applications focused on hazard prevention and useful in municipal planning. Each dataset includes layers for a base area of one hundred square kilometers around the urban center of each municipality in the Hurricane Mitch project.",
