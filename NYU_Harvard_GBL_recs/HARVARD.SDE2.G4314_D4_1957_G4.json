  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic, topographic paper map entitled: Denver and vicinity, Colorado, 1957. It was published in 1959 by the Geological Survey. Compiled from 1:24,000 scale maps of Sable, Derby, Arvada, Fort Logan, Englewood, Fitzsimons, Parker, Highlands Ranch, and Littleton 1957 7.5 minute quadrangles. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the State Plane Colorado Central NAD 1927 coordinate system (in Feet) (Fipszone 0502). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a typical topographic map portraying both natural and manmade features. It shows and names works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. It also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 10 feet. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
