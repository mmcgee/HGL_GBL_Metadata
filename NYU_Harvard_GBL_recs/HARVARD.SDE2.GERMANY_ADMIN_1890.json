The specific nomenclature of the administrative units are state-dependent: kreise in Prussia, Baden, and other states; Amtshauptmannschaften in Saxony, OberÃ¤mter in WÃ¼rttemberg, etc. In addition to identifying the administrative boundary, the map provides additional information on the state, province, and other geopolitical structures to which the administrative unit belonged. Boundary data digitized from the source maps:   Vogel, C. Karte Des Deutschen Reichs Im Massstab 1:500000. Gotha: J. Perthes, [c. 1907].",
