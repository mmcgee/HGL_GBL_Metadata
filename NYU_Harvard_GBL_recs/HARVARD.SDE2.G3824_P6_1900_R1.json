  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of the cities of Pittsburgh, Allegheny and environs. It was published by R. L. Polk and Co. in 1900. Scale [ca. 1:11,800]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Pennsylvania South State Plane NAD 1983 coordinate system (in Feet) (Fipszone 3702) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, railroad stations, street railroads, drainage, selected public buildings, cemeteries, parks, city ward boundaries, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
