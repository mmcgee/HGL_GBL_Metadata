This data was developed by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) GIS Program based on database information provided by the Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy (DHCFP) and various Internet sources. Please be aware that the attributes for the points in this layer do not include information on the type of care (e.g. specialty hospitals, acute care hospitals with emergency departments, mental health, rehabilitation, etc.) provided at each facility. Future enhancements to the layer may include such information. Therefore this layer should not be used as the primary source when seeking emergency care.",
