  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A map of the Nile, from the equatorial lakes to the Mediterranean : embracing the eastern SÃ»dan (Kordofan, Darfur  c.) and Abyssinia. It was published by E. Stanford in 1884. Scale [ca. 1:6,000,000). Covers the Nile River and Red Sea regions. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Africa Sinusoidal projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, roads, railroads, exploration routes, and more. Relief shown by hachures. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
