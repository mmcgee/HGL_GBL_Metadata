It was published by Frederick de Widt, voor aan inde Calverstraat bij den Dam, jn de 3 Crabben in 1654. Scale [ca. 1:600,000]. Covers the Baltic Sea region. Map in Dutch. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal features such as harbors, inlets, rocks, channels, points, coves, shoals, islands, and more.
