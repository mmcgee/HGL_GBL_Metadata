  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of Newport, R.I., surveyed by N.W. Eayrs, c.e. ; under the direction of J.P. Cotton, c.e. ; J. Bergner, del. It was published ca. 1892 by Simon Hart. Scale [ca. 1:13,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Rhode Island State Plane Coordinate System (Feet) (FIPS 3800). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, city ward boundaries, selected property boundaries, buildings, and names of property owners, and more.

Also includes index to points of interest (churches, schools, hotels, libraries, mills, etc.), tables of elevation and distances, and shows radial distances. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
