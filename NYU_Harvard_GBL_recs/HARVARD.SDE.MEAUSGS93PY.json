  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage displaying the USGS 7.5 minute topo quad DLG Index for Massachusetts. The data here were originally produced by MassGIS. U.S. Geological Survey's Digital Line Graph (DLG) data is available through MassGIS. The paneling scheme for the 1:25,000 (DLG) data is based on this digital quadrangle template of 210 quadrangles. The grid differs from the slightly from the 1:25,000 USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangles. For most of Massachusetts, though, the paneling schemes are identical. The quadrangle panels and numbering scheme vary along the coast, primarily for the Cape and Islands quads. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) which was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. For more information on the original MassGIS datalayer please consult their website at: http://www.state.ma.us/mgis/usgsqd.htm",
