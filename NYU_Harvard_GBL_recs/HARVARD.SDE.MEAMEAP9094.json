  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays average 4th grade MEAP (Massachusetts Educational Assessment Program) scores for towns in the Metropolitan Area Planning Council region for 1990 and 1994. School-attending children include all residents attending any public school whether the schools are in their town of residence or not. The percent change in MEAP scores between 1990 and 1994 was calculated from the given data. The MEAP testing program was last administered in spring 1996, and has since been replaced by the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAS). More information on these programs is available through the Massachusetts Department of Education (www.doe.mass.edu). Note: there is no reported data for some towns, and in each case the attribute table is coded with \"99\" or \"9999.\"  This dataset was originally prepared and distributed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. It was published as part of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is a regional planning agency representing 101 cities and towns in the metropolitan Boston area. Created by an act of the Legislature in 1963, it serves as a forum for state and local officials to address issues of regional importance. As one of 14 members of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), MAPC has oversight responsibility for the region's federally funded transportation program Stretching west from Boston to include most of the communities inside the I-495 corridor, the MAPC planning area consists of 22 cities and 79 towns. Coastal communities, older industrial centers, rural towns, and modern cities are represented within the 1,422 square miles that comprise the MAPC region.",
