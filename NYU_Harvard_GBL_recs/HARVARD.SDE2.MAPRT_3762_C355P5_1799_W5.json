  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: This chart of Cape Cod and Harbour is dedicated to the Boston Marine Society by their friend   brother, John Foster Williams. It was published in 1799. Scale [ca. 1:6,450]. Covers Cape Cod from Truro to Provincetown including Provincetown Harbor, Massachusetts. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map is a nautical chart showing coastal features such as anchor points, currents, points, inlets, coves, and more. Shows also land features: windmills, lighthouse, and buildings pictorially. Harbor depths are shown by soundings. Includes text \"Directions for sailing by Cape-Cod Light-House and into Cape-Harbour.\"  This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Massachusetts from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates (1755-1922), scales, and purposes. The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.",
