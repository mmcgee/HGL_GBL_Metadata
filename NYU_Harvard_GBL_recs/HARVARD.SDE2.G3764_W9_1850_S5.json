It was published by Smith   Mc.Kinney, between 1850 and 1860. Scale [ca. 1:3,600]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads and stations, drainage, public buildings, schools, industry locations (e.g. mills, factories, etc.), selected private buildings with names of property owners, town and ward boundaries, cemeteries, and more. Includes also engravings of important buildings and advertisements in margins. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
