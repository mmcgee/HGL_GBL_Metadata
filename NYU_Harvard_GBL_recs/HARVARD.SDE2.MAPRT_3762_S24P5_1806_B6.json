Bowditch, AM. AAS. ; assisted by Geo. Burchmore   Wm. Ropes, 3d. ; Hooker   Fairman, sc. Scale [ca. 1:20,500].  The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This nautical chart shows coastal features such as lighthouses, rocks, shoals, channels, points, coves, harbors, anchor points, islands, and more. Depths are shown by soundings and shading. Land features include settlements, selected buildings and roads, and more. Relief is shown pictorially. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Massachusetts from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates (1755-1922), scales, and purposes. The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.",
