  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Allgemeine Weltkarte auf welcher alle neue Entdeckungen eines PÃ©rouse, Wilson, Vancouver, Mungo-Park, Brown etc. dargestellt sind : nach Marcators Projection und den zuverlÃ¤ssigsten Astronomishcen Bestimungen entworsen. It was published by Simon Schropp et Comp. in 1801. Scale [ca. 1:55,000,000]. Map in German and French. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to a non-standard 'Mercator' projection with the central meridian at 152.3315 degrees east. The central meridian of this map is not the same as the Prime Meridian and may wrap or overlap itself when displayed in GIS software. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Relief is shown by hachures. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
