Albatross, Comdr. Jeff'n F. Moser, U.S.N. Comd'g ; triangulation and topography by Lieut. Hugh Rodman, U.S.N. ; magnetic observations by Ensign A.J. Hepburn, U.S.N., hydrography by Lieut. Rodman and Ensign C.S. Kempff, U.S.N. It was published by the United States Fish Commissioner in 1899. Scale 1:5,000. Covers the village of Pouheva and the North East Pass, Atoll Makemo, Archipel des Tuamotu, French Polynesia. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, human settlements, roads, buildings, boat landings, ground cover, shoreline features, bays, islands and islets, harbors, inlets, points, rocks, and more. Depths shown by soundings. Includes tide information. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
