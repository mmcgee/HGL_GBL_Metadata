  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage displaying the boundaries of the 351 communities in Massachusetts. The seaward boundary of coastal communities has been defined at mean high water in this datalayer. Note that the 351 communities are the official municipal names, not including \"villages\" or other sections of towns. The data here were originally produced by MassGIS. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) which was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. For more information on the original MassGIS datalayer please consult their website at: http://www.state.ma.us/mgisowns.htm",
