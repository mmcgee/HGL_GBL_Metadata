Predominant features represented in this layer have Census Feature Class Codes (CFCCs) of: H01 (Shoreline of perennial water feature); H11 (Perennial stream or river); H12 (Intermittent stream, river, or wash). The Feature Name attribute further identifies water bodies as rivers, reservoirs, creeks, branches, forks, etc.",
