  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of the city of Denver : showing the lines of the Denver City Tramway Co. It was published by Smith-Brooks Co., engravers and printers in 1904. Scale [ca. 1:21,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the HARN State Plane Colorado Central Zone NAD 1983 coordinate system (in Feet) (Fipszone 0502) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a partial cadastral map showing features such as roads, railroads, existing and proposed tramway lines, property lots with numbers and names of selected property owners, drainage, selected buildings, parks, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
