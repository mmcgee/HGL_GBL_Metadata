It was published by Edward Stanford in 1897. Scale 1:1,000,000. Covers Zimbabwe, and portions of Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Zambia. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Africa Lambert Conformal Conic projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, roads, railroads and stations, cities and other human settlements, territorial and administrative boundaries, shoreline features, post stations, selected mines and mining camps, and more. Relief shown by hachures and spot heights. Includes notes describing land, vegetation and availability of water.
