  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Harbor of Havana : from the most recent Spanish surveys to 1879, J.C.P. de Krafft Commo. U.S.N. Hydrographer to the Bureau of Navigation. It was published by Hydrographic Office in Jany. 1882. Scale [ca. 1:8,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'NAD 1927 Cuba Norte' coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal features such as lighthouses, buoys, beacons, rocks, channels, points, coves, islands, bottom soil types, wharves, and more. Includes also selected land features such as roads, railroads, drainage, ground cover, built-up areas and selected buildings, fortifications, and more. Relief shown by hachures; depths shown by shading and soundings. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
