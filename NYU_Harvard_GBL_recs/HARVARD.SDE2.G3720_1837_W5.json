Wells. It was published by A.F. Wilcox   Co. in 1837. Scale [ca. 1:442,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic projection (Meters). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as cities and towns, roads, railroads, drainage, churches, academies, banks, court houses, industry locations (e.g. mills, factories, mines, etc.), town, county, and state boundaries, and more. It also includes many inset maps of the major cities of New England. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
