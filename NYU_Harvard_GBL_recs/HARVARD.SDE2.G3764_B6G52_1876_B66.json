  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Proposed parks and parkways. It was published by Park Dept., City of Boston in 1876. Scale [ca. 1:25,000]. Covers also parts of adjacent towns and cities, including all of Cambridge, Somerville, and Brookline. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, proposed parks, parkways, and roads, public grounds, sewer lines, railroad stations, radial distances from City Hall, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
