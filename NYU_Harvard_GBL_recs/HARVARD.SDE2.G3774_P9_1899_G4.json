  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of Providence, Rhode Island. It was published by Geo. H. Walker   Co. in 1899. Scale [ca. 1:14,400]. Covers Providence and portions of Cranston, East Providence, Johnston, North Providence, and Warwick. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Rhode Island State Plane Coordinate System NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 3800). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, selected public buildings, schools, parks, cemeteries, city ward boundaries, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
