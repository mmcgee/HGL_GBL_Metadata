Molitoris = Erfurth, der Haupt Stadt in ThÃ¼ringen neuester mit Fleiss verfertigter Grundriss, ans Licht gestellt von Homaennischen Erben. It was published by Homannianis Heredibus in 1745. Scale [ca. 1:6,500]. Covers Erfurt, Germany. Map in Latin and German. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Deutsches Hauptdreiecksnetz (DHDN) 3-degree Gauss-Kruger Zone 4 coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, built-up areas and selected buildings, fortifications, ground cover, and more. Includes indexes and panorama of the city, below the map.
