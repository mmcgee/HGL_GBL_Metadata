This layer was vectorized from original hard copy 1:50,000 topographic maps produced by the Instituto Geogra?fico Nacional, Nicaragua. Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America during the months of October-November of 1998. From 1998 to 2001 the US Geological Survey was involved along with other federal agencies in the reconstruction effort. The source CD consists of a compilation of GIS data layers and computer applications focused on hazard prevention and useful in municipal planning. Each dataset includes layers for a base area around the urban center of each municipality in the Hurricane Mitch project.",
