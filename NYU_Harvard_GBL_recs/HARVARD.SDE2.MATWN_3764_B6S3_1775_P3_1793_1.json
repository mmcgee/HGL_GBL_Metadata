  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A plan of the action at Bunkers Hill on the 17th of June 1775 between His Majesty's troops, under the command of Major General Howe, and the American forces. The version of the map imaged here is a 1793 facsimile of the 1775 original manuscript map by Lieut. Thomas Hyde Page, of the Engineers, who acted as aide de camp to General Howe in that action ; ground plan is from an actual survey of Captn. Montresor. The facsimile was produced for Charles Stedman's The history of the origin, progress, and termination of the American war, 1794. Scale [ca. 1:4,800].     The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows troop disposition, lines of fire, and military fortifications (redoubts, entrenchments, etc.). It also shows features such as roads, buildings, drainage, and more. Relief is shown by hachures. It includes \"References to the plans\" and note. The source paper map was produced with an overlay map showing earlier stages of troop disposition; the image here is shown without the overlay. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Massachusetts from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates (1755-1922), scales, and purposes. The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.",
