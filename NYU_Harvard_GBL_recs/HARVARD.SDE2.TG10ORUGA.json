  "dc_description_s": "This polygon data layer represents the 2010 TIGER/Line Census urban growth areas for Oregon. The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Urban Growth Areas (UGAs) are legally defined entities in Oregon and Washington that the Census Bureau includes in the MTDB in agreement with each State. UGAs, which are defined around incorporated places, are used to regulate urban growth. UGA boundaries, which need not follow visible features, are delineated cooperatively by State and local officials in Oregon and Washington. Each UGA is identified by a 5-digit numeric census code, usually associated with the incorporated place for which the UGA is named. UGAs were extended to the State of Washington for the 2010 Census. The UGAs for the 2010 Census were those in effect as of January 1, 2010.",
