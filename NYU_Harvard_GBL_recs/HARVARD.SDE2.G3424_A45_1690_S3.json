  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic, untitled, manuscript paper map: [Plan of Port Royal, Nova Scotia, based on the work of Vincent Saccardy]. It was produced in 1690. Scale [ca.1:15,749]. Covers Annapolis Basin, Bay of Fundy, and Saint Marys Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the UTM Zone 20N NAD83 (meters) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal and drainage features such as harbors, inlets, rocks, channels, points, coves, shoals, islands, and more. Includes index. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
