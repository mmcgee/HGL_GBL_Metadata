Seutteri, Chalcogr. Augustae Vindelicorum. It was published by Reiner Ottens, ca. 1744. Scale [ca. 1:4,600,000]. Covers North Africa and the Mediterranean coast of Europe. Map in Latin. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Africa Sinusoidal projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, roads and routes, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Relief shown pictorially. Includes also text.
