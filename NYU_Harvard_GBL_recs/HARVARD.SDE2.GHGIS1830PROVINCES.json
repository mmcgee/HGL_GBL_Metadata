Since in 1830 only Prussia used provinces as administrative units, the provincial dataset as a layer likewise represents the territorial extension of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1820. Compared to 1826, the two most eastern located provinces of Westpreussen and Ostpreussen and have merged to now represent the province of Preussen.",
