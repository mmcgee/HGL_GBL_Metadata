  "dc_description_s": "This polygon data layer represents the 2010 TIGER/Line Census combined New England city and town areas for the United States. The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Combined New England City and Town Areas (CNECTAs) are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and consist of two or more adjacent New England City and Town Areas (NECTAs) that have significant employment interchanges. The NECTAs that combine to create a CNECTA retain separate identities within the larger combined statistical areas. Because CNECTAs represent groupings of NECTAs, they should not be ranked or compared with individual NECTAs. The CBSAs for the 2010 Census are those defined by OMB and published in December 2009.",
