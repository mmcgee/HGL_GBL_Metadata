  "dc_description_s": "These lines represent the boundary of the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund) in 1820. The confederation boundary extends beyond \"core Germany\" and includes portions of the Habsburg Empire and Luxembourg. It excludes portions of Prussia (the eastern provinces) and a small territory in Oldenburg that was under dispute and thus not part of the German Confederation in 1820. Missing segments indicate bodies water (Lake Constance) in which boundaries were not fixed at the time or which did not connect to \"core Germany\" (Adriatic Sea).",
