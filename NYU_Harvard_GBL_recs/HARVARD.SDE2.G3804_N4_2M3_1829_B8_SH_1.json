It was published by D.H. Burr for the Atlas of the state of New York, 1829. Scale [ca. 1:20,000]. This layer is image 1 of 2 total images of the two sheet source map, representing the southern portion of the map. Covers Manhattan and adjacent portions of Brooklyn, Queens, and New Jersey. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 18N NAD83 projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, selected public buildings, city wards, ferry lines, wharves, forts and more. Relief is shown by hachures.  This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
