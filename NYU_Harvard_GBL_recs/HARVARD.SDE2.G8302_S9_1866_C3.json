Lecocq de la FrÃ©mondiÃ¨re del. It was published by E. Andriveau-Goujon, Rue du Bac in 1866. Scale 1:200,000. Covers the Suez Canal region, Egypt. Map in French. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Egypt Red Belt projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, plans for the Suez Canal, other canals, roads, railroads, cities and other human settlements, ancient historic sites and ruins, shoreline features, and more. Relief shown by shading, hachures and spot heights. Depths shown by soundings. Includes insets: \"Plan de la rade de Port SaÃ¯d, et de l'embouchure du Canal dans la MÃ©diterranÃ©e\" (1:50,000), \"Plan d'IsmaÃ¯lia\" (1;20,000) and \"Plan de la rade de Suez et de l'embouchure du Canal dans la Mer Rouge\" (1:50,000). Also shows the geological profile of the Suez Canal, and crosscuts of several sections. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
