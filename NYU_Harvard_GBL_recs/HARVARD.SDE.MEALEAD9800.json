  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage representing the occurrence of elevated lead levels (greater than 15ug/dL or 15 micrograms per deciliter) in children for the years 1998, 1999 and 2000 throughout Massachusetts. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. Data here was orginally derived from the Massachusetts Office for Child Care Services.",
