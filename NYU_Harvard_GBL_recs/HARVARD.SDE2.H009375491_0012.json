Goad map set entitled: Plan d'assurance de Smyrne (Smyrna) : Turquie : plan, index, published June 1905. This image is of Plate 11. Scale 1:600. Map in French. This image includes an inset that is not georeferenced. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the European Datum 1950, UTM Zone 35 North projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. These large scale fire insurance maps typically include: building footprints, building construction material (frame, brick, plaster, stone), building heights, roof types, doors, windows, selected owner names, selected building functions, property boundaries, building street addresses, street names, railroads, water works, fire appliances, and more. Building construction material is shown by colored shading. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic fire insurance and land ownership atlases and map sets of various regions from the Harvard Map Collection. The selection of scanned atlases and maps sets represent a range of originators and ground condition dates.",
