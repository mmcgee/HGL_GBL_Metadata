  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays the counties for the state, based on a ground condition of January 1, 2000. The primary legal divisions of most states are termed ''counties.'' Each county and statistically equivalent entity is assigned a three-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code that is unique within the state. These codes are assigned in alphabetical order of county or county equivalent within each state. In Alaska, which has no counties, the statistically equivalent entities are the organized \"boroughs,\" \"city and boroughs,\" \"municipality,\" and \"census areas;\" the latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the U.S. Census Bureau.",
