Kitchin, Geographer for the Lond. Mag. It was published ca. 1774. Scale [ca. 1:90,000,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'World Mercator' projection.

This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, trade winds, magnetic variations, shoreline features, and more. Relief shown pictorially. Includes text and notes. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
