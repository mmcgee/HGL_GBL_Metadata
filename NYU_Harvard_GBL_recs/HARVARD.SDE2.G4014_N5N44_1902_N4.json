  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of the city of New Orleans : showing proposed water distribution system, [by] Sewerage and Water Board New Orleans, LA.; Geo. G. Earl, genl. sup't. It was published by the Sewerage and Water Board New Orleans in 1902. Scale [ca. 1:50,900].    The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Louisiana State Plane Coordinate System, South NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 1702). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows water distribution features such as existing and proposed water mains (with sizes), suction pipes, and water purification station sites. Also shows other features such as roads, canals, levees, drainage, cemeteries, Parish boundaries, and more. Shaded to show built-up and unbuilt areas for construction. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
