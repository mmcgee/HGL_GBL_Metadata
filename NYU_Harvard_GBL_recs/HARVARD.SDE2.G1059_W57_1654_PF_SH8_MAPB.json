  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Pas-Caart van de Middelandsche Zee : vertoonende in twee deelen, from the Frederik de Wit's untitled Dutch Sea Atlas. It was published by Frederick de Widt, inde Calverstraat by den Dam, inde dry Crabben in 1654. Scale [ca. 1:16,800,000]. Covers the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Map in Dutch. The original map contains multiple maps on one sheet. Because the map images are non-contiguous and possibly at differing scales, each map image was georeferenced separately. Please see the 'cross references' section for other maps on this sheet. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal features such as harbors, inlets, rocks, channels, points, coves, shoals, islands, and more. Includes also selected land features such as cities and towns, and other points of interest. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
