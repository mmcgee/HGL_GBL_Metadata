  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a digital raster graphic of the historic 15-minute USGS topographic map of the Blackstone, Massachusetts quadrangle. The survey date (ground condition) of this map is 1886 and the edition date is October, 1893. A digital raster graphic (DRG) is a scanned image of a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) standard series topographic map, including all map collar information. The image inside the map neatline is geo-referenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map. The names of quadrangles which border this one appear on the map collar in their respective positions (N,S,E,W) in relation to this map.",
