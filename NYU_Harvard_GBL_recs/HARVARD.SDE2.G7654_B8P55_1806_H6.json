  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A plan of Bombay harbour : principally illustrative of the entrance, constructed from measured bases, and a series of angles, taken in 1803   4 by James Horsburgh. It was published by James Horsburgh in 1806. Scale [ca.1:37,820]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Kalianpur 1975 India Zone III projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, fortification, shoreline features (rocks, shoals, anchorage points, ports, inlets, lighthouses, etc.), and more. Relief shown by depth soundings. Includes also profile views and navigational notes. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
