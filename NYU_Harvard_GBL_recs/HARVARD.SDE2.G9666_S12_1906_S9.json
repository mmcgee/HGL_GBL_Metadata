Symonds and Naval Cadet C.M. McCormick, U.S.N. of the U.S.S. Mohican, Commander B.F. Day, U.S.N. Comdg. It was printed for the Harvard Museum of the Comparative Zoology in 1906. Scale [1:82,368]. Covers Easter Island, Chile. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'Mercator' projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows shoreline features such as drainage, roads, human settlements, shoreline features, bays, harbors, coves, points, rocks, bottom types, anchorage points, and more. Relief shown by hachures, shading, and spot heights. Depth shown by soundings. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
