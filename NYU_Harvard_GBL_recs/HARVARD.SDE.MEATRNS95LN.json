  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polyline coverage displaying non-railroad transmission lines (pipelines, powerlines and other miscellaneous transmisison line-like features) throughout Massachusetts. The data here were originally produced by MassGIS. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) which was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. For more information on the original MassGIS datalayer please consult their website at: http://www.state.ma.us/mgisrnslns.htm",
