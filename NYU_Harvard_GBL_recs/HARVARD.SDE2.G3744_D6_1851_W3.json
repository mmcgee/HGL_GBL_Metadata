F. Walling, chief engineer ; John Hanson, assistant engineer. It was published in 1851. Scale [ca. 1:14,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the New Hampshire State Plane NAD 1983 coordinate system (in Feet) (Fipszone 2800). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.
