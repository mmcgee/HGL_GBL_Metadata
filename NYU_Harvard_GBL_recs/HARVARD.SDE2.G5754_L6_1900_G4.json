  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: City of Liverpool : area 14,909 acres (exclusive of half of River Mersey). It was published by George Philip   Son L[td], The London Geographical Institute in 1900. Scale [ca. 1:15,400]. Covers portions of Liverpool and Birkenhead, England. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'British National Grid' coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.

Includes index to public parks, gardens, and recreation grounds, and inset: Extension of the Garston on same scale. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
