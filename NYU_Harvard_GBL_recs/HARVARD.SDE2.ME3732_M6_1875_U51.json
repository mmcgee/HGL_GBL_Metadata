  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Mt. Desert Island, Maine, topography surveyed by J.W. Donn, assistant, between 1871-1874. It was published in Oct. 1875 by the United States Coast Survey. Scale 1:80,000. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM Zone 19N, meters, NAD 83). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, villages, selected buildings and structures, landforms, and more. Relief shown by hachures. Includes a table of heights of mountains and hills above mean high water and a table of summer level of lakes and ponds above mean high water. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
