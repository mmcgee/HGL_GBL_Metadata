  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a digital raster graphic of the historic 15-minute USGS topographic map of the Marlboro, Massachusetts quadrangle. The survey date (ground condition) of the original paper map is 1886-87, the edition date is June, 1898 and this map has a reprint date of August, 1914. A digital raster graphic (DRG) is a scanned image of a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) standard series topographic map, including all map collar information. The image inside the map neatline is geo-referenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map.",
