  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A new and correct map of the coast of Africa : from Cape Blanco lat. 20Â°40'. N. to the coast of Angola lat. 11Â°. S. : with explanatory notes of all the forts and settlements belonging to the several European powers, R. W. Seale, sculp. It was published by J. P. Knapton ca. 1753. Scale [ca. 1:10,000,000]. Covers portions of West and Central Africa. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the World Miller Cylindrical projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial claims, forts, factories, shoreline features, and more. Includes also notes, index, and inset: A separate map of the Gold Coast, upon a larger scale. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
