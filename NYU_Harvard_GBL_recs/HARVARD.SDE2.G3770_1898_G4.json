Covers Rhode Island and portions of Massachusetts and Connecticut. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Rhode Island State Plane Coordinate System (Feet) (FIPS 3800). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, bicycle routes (shown in red), drainage, county and town boundaries, and more. Includes inset: [Block Island].
