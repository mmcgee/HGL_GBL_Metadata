  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Plan of Mount Auburn, by Alexr. Wadsworth. It was published by Pendleton's Lithography in Nov. 1831. Scale [ca. 1:1,490]. This plan of Mount Auburn Cemetery (Cambridge and Watertown, Massachusetts) shows proposed paths, avenues, numbered plots, and diminished size of the ponds. Relief is shown by shading.       The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Massachusetts from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates (1755-1922), scales, and purposes. The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.",
