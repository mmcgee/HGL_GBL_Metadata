  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A draught of the coast of Africa from the streights-mouth to Cape Bona-Esprance. It was published by E. Say in 1745. Scale [ca. 1:19,000,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Africa Lambert Conformal Conic projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features (ports, shoals), and more. Shows trading posts by national claim. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
