The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the North Carolina State Plane NAD 1983 coordinate system (in Meters) (Fipszone 3200). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.

Relief shown by hachures. Includes also ill. of Confederate soldier with a plane table and Confederate flag, at left within margin. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of the Civil War from the Harvard Map Collection. Many items from this selection are from a collection of maps deposited by the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States Commandery of the State of Massachusetts (MOLLUS) in the Harvard Map Collection in 1938. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features, in particular showing places of military importance. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
