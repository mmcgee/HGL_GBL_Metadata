As compared to 1850, the territories of the former duchies of Hohenzollern have been loosely attached to the Prussian Rheinprovinz, but still maintain some administrative independence. Thus, they have been classified in the dataset as a \"province possessing limited administrative jurisdiction.\" In addition, in Hesse-Darmstadt the three provinces created in 1848 have been abolished again, so that once again only in Prussia are provinces existed.",
