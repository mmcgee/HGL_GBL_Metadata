  "dc_description_s": "The Rail Trails Datalayer is a line coverage representing abandoned railroad rights-of-way and public bike trails that use the rights-of-way. The dataset was created by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management for the purpose of regional planning and mapping. The data was originally modified by DEM from the MassGIS Railroads Datalayer; it has since been modified for DEM by the University of Massachusetts in 1997. All modifications were made using information from various paper maps, and much of the data came directly from USGS Topographic Quadrangles.",
