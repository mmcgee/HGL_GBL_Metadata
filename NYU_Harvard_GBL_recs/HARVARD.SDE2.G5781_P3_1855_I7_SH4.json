  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A general map of Ireland to accompany the report of the Railway Commissioners : shewing the principal physical features and geological structure of the country, constructed in 1836 and engraved in 1837-38. It was published by Hodges &amp; Smith in 1855. Scale [1: 253,440]. One inch to four statute miles. This layer is image 4 of 4 total images of the 4 sheet source map, representing the southeast portion of the map.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Irish Grid (Transverse Mercator 1965 (TM-65)) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.
