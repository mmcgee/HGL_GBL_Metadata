  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of Maine : constructed from the most correct surveys, with sectional distances and elevations, or level, of the St. Croix River from Calais Bridge, deduced from the states survey, made by W. Anson, civil engineer, in 1836. Engraved   published in 1837 by S.H. Colesworthy. Scale [ca. 1:925,000]. Covers Maine and portions of New Hampshire, the provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick, Canada. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM Zone 19N, meters, NAD 83). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage; land grant, town, county, state, and national boundaries, and more.  This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
