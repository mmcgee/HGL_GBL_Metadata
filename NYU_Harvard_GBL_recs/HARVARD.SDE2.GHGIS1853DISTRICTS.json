All were located within the (future) boundaries of the German Empire that would be founded in 1871 (\"core Germany\"). In 1853, governmental districts formed the middle level administrative units in nearly all of the larger territorial German states: Prussia, Hanover, Saxony, Bavaria, Wurttemberg, Baden, Hesse-Kassel, and Hesse-Darmstadt.",
