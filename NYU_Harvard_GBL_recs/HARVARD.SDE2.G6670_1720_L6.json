Aug. Vindel. It was published by Seutter Matthaeus in 1720. The original sheet map contains 2 maps on 1 sheet. This dataset is georeferenced to the larger scale map entitled: Gibraltar. Scale [ca. 1:12,100]. Map in Latin, German, and French. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the European Datum 1950, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 30N projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, built-up areas and selected buildings, fortification, ground cover, coastal features, and more. Relief shown pictorially. Depths shown by soundings. Includes indexes. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
