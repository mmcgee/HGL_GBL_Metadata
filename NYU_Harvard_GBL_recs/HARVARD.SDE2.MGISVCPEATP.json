  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer contains polygons representing Massachusetts Priority Natural Vegetation Communities : Acidic Peatland Community Systems. The data covers only a portion of eastern Massachusetts. Acidic Peatland Systems include evergreen forest and shrub bogs, Atlantic White Cedar (AWC) swamps and bogs, and shrub and graminoid fens. This layer is part of the MassGIS Priority Natural Vegetation Communities dataset, which depicts the distribution of the eight natural community systems identified by the Massachusetts Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program (NHESP) as most critical to the conservation of the Commonwealth's biological diversity (Barbour et al., 1998).",
