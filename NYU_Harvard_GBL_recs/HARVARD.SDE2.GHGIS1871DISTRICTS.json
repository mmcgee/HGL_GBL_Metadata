Governmental districts formed the middle level administrative units in nearly all of the larger federated German states which continued to form the Empire: Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria, Wurttemberg, Baden, and Hesse-Darmstadt. Of all the larger federated states, only Mecklenburg continued not having middle-level administrative units.",
