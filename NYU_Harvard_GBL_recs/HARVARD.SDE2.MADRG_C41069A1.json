  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a digital raster graphic of the 1- by 2-degree USGS topographic map of the Providence, Rhode Island quadrangle (NK 19-7), 1969, covering portions of Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and a large portion of southeastern Massachusetts including Cape Cod, Nantucket, and Martha's Vineyard. Scale 1:250,000. It is part of the Eastern United States 1:250,000 series (V501) (1- by 2-degree quadrangles) produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. The DRG was published in 1997.   A digital raster graphic (DRG) is a scanned image of a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) standard series topographic map, including all map collar information. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map. The source paper map was prepared by the U.S. Army Topographic Command and published by the United States Geological Survey. Compiled in 1947 from United States Quadrangles, 1:25,000, 1:31,680, 1:62,500, 1893-1946. Planimetry revised from aerial photographs taken 1939-1943. Revised by the U.S. Geological Survey 1969. Selected hyrdrographic data compiled from USC GS Charts. The names and numbers of the quadrangles which neighbor this one appear in a location diagram on the map collar in their respective positions (N,S,E,W) in relation to this map.",
