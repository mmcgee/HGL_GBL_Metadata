  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Fiji Islands : reduced from admirality chart no. 2691, B. Meisel lith. It was published by B. Meisel in 1900. Scale [ca. 1:2,300,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to a non-standard 'Mercator' projection with the central meridian at 180 degrees west. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. Note: The central meridian of this map is not the same as the Prime Meridian and may wrap the International Date Line or overlap itself when displayed in GIS software. This map shows features such as drainage, shoreline features, bays, harbors, inlets, points, rocks, reefs, islands and islets, and more. Relief shown by spot heights. Depths shown by soundings. Inset: Fiji Islands: Continuation of group to southward. Shows also the track of the Yaralla. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
