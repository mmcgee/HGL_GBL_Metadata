  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Wm. T. Brigham on Hawaiian volcanoes, G.W. Boynton, sc. Pl. 12 : Oahu. The Hawaiin group. It was published by the Boston Society of Natural History in [1868]. This dataset is georeferenced for the component map entitled: The Hawaiian group. Scale [ca. 1:4,500,000]. Covers the Hawai'ian Islands. The original map contains multiple maps on one sheet. Because the map images are non-contiguous and possibly at differing scales, each map image was georeferenced separately. Please see the 'cross references' section for other maps on this sheet. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'Mercator' projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as volcanoes, shoreline features, islands and islets, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
