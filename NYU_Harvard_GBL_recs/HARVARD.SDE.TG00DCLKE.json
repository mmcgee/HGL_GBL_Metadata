These features are neither transportation nor hydrographic in nature but may be used to determine boundary lines. The single Feature Code in this layer is E10 (Fence line locating a visible and permanent fence between separately identified property). Additional features which may be identified in this, or other layers, include: Topographic Feature:Topographical features that may be used as boundaries or as a reference for an area. The Census TIGER database contains topographic features used to define the limits of statistical entities in locations where no other visible feature can be identified.
