  "dc_description_s": "Flood inundation polygons for the 50-year flood, due to storm surge for Santa Rosa de AguÃ¡n, Honduras. The elevation of the 50-year storm surge was estimated to be 4.35 meters above normal sea level based on hurricane probabilites and published storm-surge elevations associated with various hurricane catagories. An airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) topographic survey of the area provided a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the area. The flood inundation  was computed as the distance from the bare-earth surface of the land represented by the LIDAR-derived DEM to an elevation of 4.35 meters.",
