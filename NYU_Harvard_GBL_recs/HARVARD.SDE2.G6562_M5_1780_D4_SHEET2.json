  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A topographical map of the Isle of Minorca, geometrically survey'd by the Royal Engineers, while it remained in the possesion of the French during the last war ; and digested by L.S. de la Rochette. It was published by William Faden in 1780. Scale [ca. 1:52,800]. Covers Minorca Island, Spain. This layer is image 2 of 2 total images of the two sheet source map, representing the eastern portion of the map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the European Datum 1950, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 31N projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, roads, villages and other human settlements, fortifications, shoreline features, ground cover, and more. Relief shown by hachures. Includes text and \"Explanation of some Minorcan names.\"  This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection.
