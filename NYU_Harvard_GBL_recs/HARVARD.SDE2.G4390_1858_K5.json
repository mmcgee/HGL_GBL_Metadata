  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A new map of tropical-America, north of the Equator : comprising the West-Indies, Central-America, Mexico, New Cranada [sic] and Venezuela by H. Kiepert. It was published by Dietrich Reimer in 1858. Scale [ca. 1:3,600,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the World Miller Cylindrical projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, roads, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries and colonial claims, shoreline features, and more. Relief shown by hachures and spot heights. Includes also text and inset map: Central part of the Mexican Republic on an enlarged scale, based upon the surveys published by A. v. Humboldt, v. Gerolt, Heller, Smith and the Sociedad Mejicana de GeografÃ­a y EstadÃ­stica. Scale 1:1,000,000. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
