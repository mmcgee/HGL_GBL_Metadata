Seven Sole Source Aquifers have been designated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Massachusetts. The Sole Source Aquifers are stored as a statewide polygon coverage, AQ_SOLE. A Sole Source Aquifer (SSA) is an aquifer designated by US EPA as the 'sole or principal source' of drinking water for a given aquifer service area; that is, an aquifer which is needed to supply 50% or more of the drinking water for that area and for which there are no reasonably available alternative sources should that aquifer become contaminated.",
