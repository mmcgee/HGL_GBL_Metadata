  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage for births in Massachusetts between 1990-1993. This file provides the total number of births, number of White births, non-Hispanic births, African American births, Hispanic births, and Asian births. These statistics were originally compiled and published by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health: Division of Research and Epidemiology. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.",
