  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of Franklin County, Massachusetts : based upon the trigonometrical survey of the state, the details from actual surveys under the direction of H.F. Walling, supt. of the state map. It was published by Smith   Ingraham in 1858. Scale [ca. 1:47,520]. This layer is image 1 of 3 total images, representing the northwest portion of the four sheet source map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, public buildings, schools, churches, cemeteries, industry locations (e.g. mills, factories, mines, etc.), private buildings with names of property owners, town and school district boundaries, and more.

The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.",
