  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polyline coverage displaying major streams and rivers throughout Massachusetts. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) which was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. The data here were originally produced by MassGIS. More information on their original datalayer may be found at: http://www.state.ma.us/mgis/hd100_.htm",
