Kaempfer ; [engraved by] I. G. S. It was published by chez R. [et] I. Ottens in 1730. Scale [ca. 1:350,000]. Covers the Chao Phraya River region, Thailand. Map in French and Dutch. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM Zone 47N, meters, WGS 1984) projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, administrative boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Includes notes and inset map of Judia [i.e. Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya]. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
