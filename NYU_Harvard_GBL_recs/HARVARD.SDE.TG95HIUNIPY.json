The National School District Program has mapped Attendance Zones for each school in the district. A unified school district is inclusive of kindergarten through twelfth grade. The Census Bureau defines a school district as the territory administered by the elected or appointed authorities of a state, county, or other local governmental unit to provide educational services to a resident population. A school district typically includes several school buildings, teachers, and related staff. The Census Bureau provided data tabulations for school districts from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses.",
