  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Pacific Ocean : compiled from Admiralty surveys   other official sources by the India-Rubber, Gutta-Percha   Telegraph Works Co. It was published by J.D. Potter in [1899]. Scale [ca. 1:15,000,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to a non-standard 'Mercator' projection with the central meridian at 170 degrees west. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. Note: The central meridian of this map is not the same as the Prime Meridian and may wrap the International Date Line or overlap itself when displayed in GIS software. This map shows features such as drainage, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Relief shown by hachures. Depths shown by soundings. Shows routes of Admiralty surveys. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
