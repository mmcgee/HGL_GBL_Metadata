W. Bouve ; reduced from plan of survey by A. Wadsworth, Esq. ; with additions by Henry S. McKean. It was published ca. 1840. Scale [1:1,200]. Covers properties on Trowbridge St., Ellery St., and Dana St. between Harvard St. and Broadway, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Covers also Harvard Yard with building footprints and footpaths.    The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a partial cadastral map showing features such as: lot numbers, dimensions, and areas of properties, selected surrounding building footprints with names of occupants, roads, and more.
