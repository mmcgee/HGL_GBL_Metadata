  "dc_description_s": "The datalayer contains the majority of the facilities currently regulated under DEP's solid waste regulations (310 CMR 16.00   19.00). The 579 polygons in the datalayer include thirteen specific types of solid waste facilities. Please Note: Although the majority of the polygons represent landfills, only a small fraction of those landfills are active. In addition, this datalayer does not contain all solid waste facilities known to DEP. The MassGIS land-use datalayer has waste site and mining classifications which may represent landfills not in the solid waste datalayer.",
