Verwest. It was published by Librairie Falk Fils in 1907. Scale 1:10,000. Covers a portion of Brussels, Belgium. Map in French. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Belgian Lambert 1972 coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads and stations, street-railroads, drainage, built-up areas and selected buildings, parks, ground cover, city districts, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
