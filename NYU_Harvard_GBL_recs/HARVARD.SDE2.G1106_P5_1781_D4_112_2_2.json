  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the untitled, historic nautical chart: [A chart of Great Bluehill Bay, Penobscot River  c.] (sheet originally published in 1776). The map is [sheet 41] from the Atlantic Neptune atlas Vol. 3 : Charts of the coast and harbors of New England, from surveys taken by Samuel Holland and published by J.F.W. Des Barres, 1781. Scale [ca. 1:50,000]. This layer is image 2 of 2 total images of the two sheet source map, representing the eastern portion of the map. Covers a portion of Penobscot Bay, including Blue Hill Bay, Deer Island,  and Eggemoggin Reach, Maine.   The image is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'World Mercator' (WGS 84) projected coordinate system. All map collar information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal features such as harbors, inlets, rocks, channels, points, coves, shoals, islands, and more. Includes also selected land features such as cities and towns, and buildings. Relief is shown by hachures; depths by soundings. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection. The entire Atlantic Neptune atlas Vol. 3 : Charts of the coast and harbors of New England has been scanned and georeferenced as part of this selection.",
