  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic, paper map entitled: Surficial geology of the Chicago Loop quadrangle, by J. Harlen Bretz. It was published by State Geological Survey Division ca. 1936. Scale 1:24,000. Topographic base surveyed in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey, 1926; 1936. Geologically surveyed 1930-1932. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Illinois East State Plane Coordinate System NAD27 (in Feet) (Fipszone 1201). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a typical topographic map colored to show surficial geology. It portrays both natural and manmade features. It shows and names works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. It also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 5 feet. Includes legend and map index. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
