  "dc_description_s": "The MassGIS Land Use datalayer has 37 land use classifications interpreted from 1:25,000 aerial photography. Coverage is complete statewide for 1971, 1985, and 1999. Additionally, more than half the state was interpreted from aerial photography flown during 1990, 1991, 1992, 1995 or 1997. The 15 towns on Cape Cod also contain land use data for 1951. Please see the Land Use Status Map (http://www.mass.gov/mgis/st_lus.htm), which displays the years for which land use data were interpreted for each town. The year of most recent photography used for land use data interpretation is stored in a single statewide coverage called LUSTAT (http://www.mass.gov/mgis/ftplus.htm). This layer was necessitated because some towns contain partial coverage for a certain year, which eliminated the one-to-one link between town-ID and year.",
