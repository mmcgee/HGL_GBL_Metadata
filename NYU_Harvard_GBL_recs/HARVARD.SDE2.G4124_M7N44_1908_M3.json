  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of the city of Milwaukee : showing water pipe distribution, accompanying report of the city engineer for 1908. It was published in 1908. Scale 1:1,200. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Wisconsin South NAD 1983 coordinate system (in Feet) (Fipszone 4803) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as water pipes, drainage, roads, railroads, canals, parks, cemeteries, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more.   This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
