Ducis Holsato-Gottorpiensis Sedes et celebre Emporium Kilonium una cum ejus Portu ichno- et scenographice accurate delineatum, delineante G. C. Holmer.

The larger scale map of Kiel is the portion of the image that has been georeferenced. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Deutsches Hauptdreiecksnetz (DHDN) 3-degree Gauss-Kruger Zone 3 coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, built-up areas and selected buildings, fortifications, ground cover, and more. Includes also indexes and 2 views of Kiel. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features.
