  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Plan de Tunis et ses environs, [dessinÃ© par J. Vanney]. It was published by C. Saliba aÃ®nÃ© between 1910-1911. Scale 1:8,000. Map in French. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM Zone 32N, meters, WGS 1984) projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, roads, railroads and stations, selected buildings and built-up areas, shoreline features, parks, fortification, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
