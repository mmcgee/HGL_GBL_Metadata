  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic, topographic paper map entitled: Chicago and vicinity, Ill.-Ind. : sheet no. 3 of 3 (Blue Island), 1953, mapped, edited, and published by the Geological Survey. It was published in 1957. Scale 1:24,000. The source map was compiled from 1:24,000 scale maps of Calumet Lake, Blue Island, Palos Park, Sag Bridge, Mokena, Tinley Park, Harvey, and Calumet City 1953 7.5 minute quadrangles. Hydrography from U.S. Lake Survey Chart 755 (1:15,000). This layer is image 3 of 3 total images of the three sheet source map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Illinois East State Plane Coordinate System NAD27 (in Feet) (Fipszone 1201). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a typical topographic map portraying both natural and manmade features. It shows and names works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. It also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 5 feet. Depths shown by isolines and soundings. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
