  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: [Topographische Karte 1:25 000] : Hamburg (1029). It was published by Konig[liche] Preuss[ische] Landes-Aufnahme in 1878. Scale 1:25,000. This layer is image 1 of 4 total images of the four sheet source map, representing the southwest portion of the map. Covers the Hamburg region, Germany. Map in German. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Deutsches Hauptdreiecksnetz (DHDN) 3-degree Gauss-Kruger Zone 3 coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads and stations, drainage, built-up areas and selected buildings, ground cover, gardens, docks, wharves, and more. Relief shown by contours and spot heights. Depths shown by soundings. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
