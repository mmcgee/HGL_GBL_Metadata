It was published by Chez Jean CÃ³vens et Corneille Mortier, GÃ©ographes between 1720 and 1729. Scale [ca. 1:9,100,000]. Covers Central and Southern Africa from N 2 degrees southward, including Madagascar, Reunion, Mauritius and the Seychelles. Map in French. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Africa Sinusoidal projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, roads, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Includes notes. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
