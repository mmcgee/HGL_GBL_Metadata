Walling, supt. of the state map. It was published by Ferd. Mayer   Co. in 1855. Scale 1:15,000.

All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map.
