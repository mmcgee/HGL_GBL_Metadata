  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Rand McNally   Co.'s new street number guide map of Chicago, Rand McNally   Co. It was published by Rand McNally   Co. ca. 1916. Scale [ca. 1:37,500]. This layer is image 1 of 2 total images of the double-sided source map, representing the northern portion of the map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Illinois East State Plane Coordinate System NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 1201). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, railroad stations, team tracks, street car lines, elevated roads, drainage, parks, boulevards, city boundaries, and more. Includes index to railroads and explanation. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
