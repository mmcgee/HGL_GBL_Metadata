P. a fait dans ces mers en diferens temps, et les sondes des costes et ports qu'il a reconnus ; avec Privilege du Roy, dressÃ©e par le R. P. Tachard de la Compagnie de Jesus.

Covers the Bay of Bengal region and the southern coast of Asia from Surat, India to the Gulf of Thailand, including Sri Lanka, Maldives, and a portion of Indonesia. Map in French. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the World Miller Cylindrical projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as rocks, channels, points, ports, coves, islands, shoals, anchorage points, and more.
