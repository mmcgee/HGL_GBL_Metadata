It was published by E. Stanford in 1873. Scale 1:6,336,000. Covers portions of West and Central Africa. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Africa Sinusoidal projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries and claims, roads, exploration routes, shoreline features, and more. Relief shown by hachures and spot heights. Includes notes. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection.
