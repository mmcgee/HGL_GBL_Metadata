  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Rail-road crossings and termini in the vicinity of Boston,  E.S. Chesbrough, commissioner ; reduced from a drawing by Chas. Perkins. It was published in 1850. Scale [1:7,200]. Covers Boston proper (Shawmut Peninsula and Boston Neck) and portions of Cambridge and Somerville, Massachusetts.    The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as railroads, railroad depots, railroad crossings, road, drainage, some public buildings, bridges, wharves, and more. Relief is shown by hachures. The accompanying profiles of railroad crossings are published separately under the title: Sections of railroad crossings in the vicinity of Boston.  This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Massachusetts from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates (1755-1922), scales, and purposes. The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.",
