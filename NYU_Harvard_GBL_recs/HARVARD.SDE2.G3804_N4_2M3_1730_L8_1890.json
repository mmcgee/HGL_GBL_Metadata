  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A plan of the city of New York from an actual survey, made by James Lyne. It was reproduced by Henry Dunreath Tyler ca. 1890. Scale [ca. 1:3,200]. Covers lower Manhattan below Worth St. Facsimile of an original map made in 1728 appearing in various eds. of Valentine's Manual of New York. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 18N NAD83 projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, selected public buildings (churches, markets, etc.), city wards, wharves, and more. Relief is shown by hachures. Includes index to points of interest. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
